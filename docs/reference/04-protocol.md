# Protocol

Protocol version: `1` (`src/index.ts` `PROTOCOL_VERSION`). Schemas: `schemas/v1/`.

## Addresses

```
orchestrator
worker:<slug>
reviewer:<slug>
```

`slug` is `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`. See `src/protocol.ts` `isAddress`. Workers do not send to workers. The CLI and MCP surface pass one recipient. The engine can fan out to many; that path is not exposed on `promptobus_send`.

## Message types

`task`, `status`, `question`, `answer`, `artifact`, `result`, `review` (`MESSAGE_TYPES`). The exported `MESSAGE_TYPES` and `MESSAGE_TYPES_V1` names are the same frozen readonly list: consumers can enumerate or copy it, but cannot add, remove, or replace a type and thereby change validation for the process.

`artifactPath` on send is an absolute file path. The file is copied into the task store. The message stores the artifact name.

During a consuming mailbox read, a filesystem refusal while reading or moving one record is reported with the errno in `BrokenNote.code` and leaves its ref in place for a later consuming read. The same pass still returns every message it already moved to history. The unread ref keeps the mailbox unread, so the warden repeats its knock until the filesystem condition is lifted. `recover()` applies the same per-record rule to an unreadable intent: it reports the errno, leaves the intent in place, and continues through the other intents and tasks. Only a record that was read and found malformed is moved to `broken/`.

## Engine

`openEngine({ root, policy })` or `openEngine({ home, policy })`. Exactly one of `root` / `home`. `policy` is required at open: a callback `{ allow: true } | { deny: true, reason }` per sender/recipient pair.

The engine does not wake anyone. It returns activation events. The warden and the driver wake the session.

Recovery is local to one intent. `RecoverResult` carries `repairs`, activation `events`, unreadable `broken` records, and `failed` fan-outs. A classified hard-link refusal adds `{ task, message, code: "link-refused", note }` to `failed`, leaves the intent for the next pass, and continues through the other intents and tasks. If materialization finds that both the intent and canon are gone, the same entry instead carries `code: "intent-lost"`: the message is permanently lost and will not be retried, but recovery still continues. Neither result aborts `openEngine({ recover: true })`. Other exceptions escape; recovery does not hide programmer errors or broaden the filesystem refusal taxonomy.

The bus adapter opens with implicit recovery disabled, calls `recover()` once on the first access to a store in the process, and prints warnings for repaired fan-outs, unreadable records, retryable refusals, and permanent message loss before caching the engine. Both failure classes are therefore visible while `status`, `history`, `prune`, the warden, and MCP calls can still open the store. A later process retries only a retained `link-refused` intent.

Mail is kept until read. Read is a rename from `inbox/` to `history/`. There is no exactly-once processing after that.

## Participant metadata

The v1 record's own fields are `id`, `role`, `harness`, `mode`, `sessionRef`, `capabilities`. Everything else the adapter writes about a participant lives in `metadata`, which the core does not look into, and the door into it is the accessors of `src/protocol.ts` — not a scatter of `p.metadata.<field>` reads.

`metadata.routing` is one such field: the decision a lift made under `--strategy` ([03-cli](03-cli.md) § Model routing). It is written by `spawn` and `review` at the lift and read by `promptobus status` through `routingOf`, and it carries the strategy, the role, the tuple (`tupleId`, `harness`, `model`, `effort`), the chosen candidate's `score`, `strategySource` when the strategy came from a merged `defaults.strategy` rather than from a flag — absent when a person typed one, because there is nowhere else that value could have come from — the `snapshot` the pick was made on (`takenAt`, `ageSec`, `source`), the `windows` applicable to the chosen tuple with the `usedPercent` they had at that moment — the starting value the spend of a run is later read as a delta from, empty when the harness reported none — the `warnings` as codes, and the `constraints` with `applied`. An unrouted participant has no such field.

**The protocol version is not raised for it.** `metadata` is declared open in `schemas/v1/participant.schema.json`, so a record carrying a routing decision is readable by a mechanism of any version — which is exactly what that field exists for. A routed run is not migrated to and not migrated from: the decision describes the lift that happened, and a reader that does not know the field ignores it.

## Artifacts

An artifact is attached to a send. There is no separate upload command. Blobs are content-addressed (`blobs/<sha256>`) and immutable inside one task. A digest mismatch on read is `artifact-integrity`.

## Claim

The orchestrator mailbox is owned by the session that opened the task. Another session gets a copy and a foreign-mailbox header. `promptobus_mailbox` with `claim: true` takes ownership when the previous session is gone. `src/protocol.ts` names the header constants.
